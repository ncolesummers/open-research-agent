# Phase 2 Implementation Plan

## Overview

Phase 2 transforms the Open Research Agent from sequential to parallel execution, implementing the supervisor-researcher pattern for concurrent task processing.

**Duration:** 2.5-3 weeks (12-16 days)  
**Goal:** Achieve 3-5x throughput improvement through parallel research execution

## GitHub Issues

### Epic
- **#2** - [EPIC] Phase 2: Workflow Engine - Parallel Research Execution

### Sprint 1: Foundation & Worker System (5-7 days)
- **#3** - [STORY] Implement Worker Pool Infrastructure for Concurrent Research Execution
- **#4** - [STORY] Enhance Supervisor Node for Intelligent Task Distribution  
- **#5** - [STORY] Transform Researcher Node into Concurrent Worker Pattern

### Sprint 2: Tool System Enhancement (4-5 days)
- **#6** - [STORY] Implement Web Search Tool with DuckDuckGo Integration
- **#7** - [STORY] Implement Summarize Tool for Content Compression
- **#8** - [STORY] Enhance Think Tool with LLM-Based Reasoning Chains

### Sprint 3: Integration & Testing (3-4 days)
- **#9** - [STORY] End-to-End Integration of Parallel Research Workflow
- **#10** - [STORY] Comprehensive Testing Suite for Parallel Research System

## Success Criteria

✅ **Functional Requirements**
- Parallel task execution with configurable concurrency (MaxConcurrency: 5)
- Supervisor-researcher pattern fully implemented
- Tool chain integration (search → think → summarize)
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff for failed tasks
- Thread-safe state management with result aggregation

✅ **Performance Requirements**
- 3-5x throughput improvement over sequential execution
- Linear scaling up to MaxConcurrency workers
- First results available within 2 seconds
- Complete research within 30 seconds for standard queries

✅ **Quality Requirements**
- Maintain >70% test coverage
- Zero race conditions detected
- <1% task failure rate after retries
- Comprehensive observability with OpenTelemetry

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Worker Pool Pattern
```go
type WorkerPool struct {
    workers    []*ResearcherWorker
    taskQueue  chan *domain.ResearchTask
    resultChan chan *domain.ResearchResult
    maxWorkers int
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Supervisor
- Intelligent task distribution based on priority and load
- Dependency resolution for complex research graphs
- Real-time progress monitoring and reporting

### 3. Concurrent Researchers
- Independent goroutine-based workers
- Tool chain execution per task
- Result quality scoring and confidence metrics

### 4. Tool Integration
- **Web Search:** DuckDuckGo API with caching
- **Think:** Chain-of-thought reasoning with LLM
- **Summarize:** Content compression with quality scoring

## Getting Started

1. **Review Phase 1 completion** - Ensure foundation is solid
2. **Start with Sprint 1** - Build worker infrastructure first
3. **Implement incrementally** - Test each component thoroughly
4. **Integration last** - Combine all pieces in Sprint 3

## Dependencies

- Phase 1 must be complete (domain models, state management, LLM client)
- Go 1.21+ for improved concurrency features
- Ollama running locally for LLM integration
- No external libraries required for core functionality

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Race conditions | High | Comprehensive mutex usage, `go test -race` |
| Resource exhaustion | Medium | Bounded channels, worker limits |
| Cascading failures | High | Circuit breakers, graceful degradation |
| State inconsistency | High | Transaction-like updates, snapshots |

## Notes

- Each issue contains detailed acceptance criteria and implementation guidance
- Issues are designed to be self-contained for independent development
- User story template available at `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/user_story.md`
- Maintain observability-driven development throughout implementation
